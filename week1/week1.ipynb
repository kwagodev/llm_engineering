      "text/markdown": "- Edward Donner’s homepage: a classic tech-nerd meet-corny-portfolio fusion. Big words about AI, code, and “amateur electronic music” to prove he’s multi-hyphenate and not just a guy who talks about ML. \n\n- The vibe: Ed is a tech leader and entrepreneur (co-founder/CTO of Nebula.io, ex-untapt founder/CEO, with a big wink about a 2021 acquisition). He also brags about Udemy best-sellers with 400,000 students—because nothing says humility like “I changed your career, maybe.”\n\n- The tech brag, in tastefully loud form: lots of WordPress blocks, Jetpack forms, and Yoast SEO sprinkled around a hero that says “Well, hi there.” Yes, it’s as WordPress-y as you’d expect, just glossier.\n\n- The hook: Keep in touch via a Jetpack contact form, because apparently emails are still a thing, and Ed wants to “add value” with every message. Also, there’s a newsletter subscribe block to remind you he’s got more content than your inbox can handle.\n\n- The content grid: a four-post showcase of his AI/LLM-ish writing:\n  - AI Builder with n8n – Create Agents and Voice Agents (2026-01-04)\n  - The Unique Energy of an AI Live Event (2025-11-11)\n  - AI Engineering MLOps Track – Deploy AI to Production (2025-09-15)\n  - Which order to take the AI courses? (2025-05-28)\n\n- The “Get in touch”/footer vibe: a mini ecosystem of navigation, contact details, social links (LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Facebook), and a separate newsletter signup. It’s basically a one-stop shop to hire him, read his posts, or enroll in more courses.\n\n- TL;DR: It’s Ed Donner’s personal AI-and-CTO-brand playground—plenty of bragging, a few forms, and a shiny grid of posts proving he actually builds stuff (and writes about it). If you’re into AI, coding, and celebrity-level course stats, this is your jam."
